**Unit 1: Setting the Stage** <span id="1"></span> 
*In technical communication, one usually has a specific purpose and a
specific audience in mind.  The purpose and audience (in conjunction
with the context in which the information will be presented, received,
and used) help you determine the appropriate medium and genre of
communication.  For example, consider the different modes or genres of
writing that would be required of the following types of communication:
an instruction manual for a complex piece of equipment aimed at a global
audience, notification of a suggested part substitution in that piece of
equipment for one of your immediate colleagues, a proposal to your
supervisors for substantial modification of that piece of equipment, a
summary of the results of that substitution after six months have
passed, and documentation of safety compliance aimed at governmental
regulatory agencies.  In all cases, identifying the purpose of the
communication, the target audience, and its context with respect to
other communications is crucial for success.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 10 hours to complete.

    as you see it.  Is it imperative to define technical writing or
    engineering communication in order to make use of something
    resembling it?
