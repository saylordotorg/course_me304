**Unit 4: Specific Genres and Design** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit presents the details of formatting, organizing, and using
several written communication genres.  You need not memorize all of
these standard formats, but you should familiarize yourself with their
existence and utility and make note of references for future use.  It
may seem that formats and organizational styles are rather arbitrary at
first, but with experience reading and writing them, you will come to
recognize their logic.  By examining the differences in formats and
styles, you may in fact develop an appreciation for their utility.*  
  
 *The unit will conclude with information on formatting and style
applicable to oral presentations and audio/visual aids.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 32 hours to complete.
