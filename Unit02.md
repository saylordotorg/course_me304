**Unit 2: Rules or Guidelines?** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit presents some basic rules for communication.  Adherence to
these rules is not meant to stifle communication, but rather to
facilitate it by allowing both the presenter and the reader/listener to
focus on the message rather than the way in which it is presented. 
Errors in grammar and punctuation and inappropriate style, formatting,
and typography can all detract from communicating your purpose.  We will
conclude the unit with a discussion of proper attribution of source
materials, fair use others’ work, and plagiarism—what it is and how to
avoid it.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 18 hours to complete.
