Effective communication is essential to teamwork, and teamwork is
essential to accomplishing complex engineering work.  In this course,
you will learn several aspects of effective technical communication that
will help prepare you to work successfully on an engineering team.  The
strategies and techniques learned here are also applicable to other
situations—for example, preparing a résumé and cover letter, conducting
a successful job interview, negotiating to make a major purchase or
sale, and navigating through legal situations that you might encounter.
As an example, consider the following situation.  You arrive home after
a week-long vacation and find a note on your door saying: *Dude – My
plumber’s cut your phone cord.  I reckon they’ll fix it soon.* On the
other hand, consider that you find a note resembling:   *From: John
Atkins      October 24, 2015* *2828 Fairlane Rd.* *Tel: 703-555-4800*  
*To:       Occupant* *2824 Fairlane Rd.*   *I regret to inform you that
my plumbing contractor (Easy-Time Plumbing) inadvertently* *cut our
phone lines while performing drainage work for me.  Your phone should be
back* *in service by October 25, 2015.  Should you have any questions or
concerns, please* *contact either me at the above address or the
plumber, Mr. Philip Smith, at Easy-Time* *Plumbing, 4867 Dogview Rd.,
Fairtown 38565 (Tel: 703-555-4899).  I regret the* *inconvenience.* Both
notes are likely to cause some frustration, but which would you rather
receive?  This course will teach you to pay attention to these
differences in order to effectively communicate in a variety of
situations. This course consists of four units.  In the first unit, you
will learn about assessing contexts for communication and
characteristics of the intended audience.  You will also learn about a
range of communication genres appropriate to a variety of different
situations.  In the example concerning the cut telephone line above, the
latter, brief note with contact details is sufficient; a complete report
detailing the plumber’s project would not be appropriate and would
detract from the message that the sender wished to convey.  This unit
will help you assess a given context in order to determine the
appropriate mode of communication. In the second unit, you will learn
about rules for written correspondence, including those pertaining to
grammar, style, formatting, organization, and attribution.  In the first
note above, for example, the casual, ungrammatical style might cause
some worry for the reader.  This unit will help you avoid these
unintended consequences. In the third unit, you will consider effective
strategies for collaborative writing, and will continue in the fourth
unit with consideration of the specific formats, styles, and
organizational strategies required of different forms of written and
oral communication, ranging from memoranda to complete reports.  In the
fifth and final unit, you will practice what you have learned by
designing a memorandum, cover letter, complete report, and slide
presentation for a topic which you have encountered in another Saylor
Foundation course (ME301: Measurement & Experimentation Laboratory). You
may learn much about technical communication by reading the source
materials and practicing the exercises in this course.  However, the
best way to learn is to practice writing and speaking to various
audiences and to work with others in planning and writing such
presentations.  In doing so, keep the source materials you find in this
course at hand; with practice, you will become less reliant upon them.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Define the purpose of effective technical communication.

-   Define and avoid plagiarism and implement appropriate citations.
-   Brainstorm and prepare and revise documents independently and
    collaboratively.
-   Organize and present information in written, visual, and oral modes
    in compliance with standard formats.
