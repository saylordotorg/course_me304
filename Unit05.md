**Unit 5: Writing a Laboratory Report** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit you shall use the data and experience gained in Exercise
8.6 of the Saylor Foundation’s* *ME301: Measurement & Experimentation
Laboratory as the basis of a laboratory report.  In that exercise, you
gathered and analyzed data to describe the dynamics of a thermometer. 
In this unit, you shall organize that information into a report with a
threefold purpose: to communicate your data and experiences to peers, to
propose improvements to procedure, and to summarize the dynamics of a
specific thermometer. You may consider your audience to include both
peers and experienced mechanical engineers.*  
          
 **This unit is your opportunity to improve your understanding of the
details learned in other units.  Actually performing the exercise
outlined here will force you to consider details of technical writing
and document preparation that you would not consider if just reading
about the process.  The Unit 5 Quiz provides examples of that level of
mastery.**

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 23 hours to complete.
