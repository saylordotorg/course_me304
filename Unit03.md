**Unit 3: Collaborative Writing** <span id="3"></span> 
*Communication and collaboration go hand-in-hand.  We begin this unit
with a brief discussion of the process of collaborative writing; this
process is just a generalization of that which one would employ if
working alone.  We then explore some formal tools for collaboration. In
particular you will gain experience with computer based systems which
permit multiple authors and editors to work on a document simultaneously
(or nearly so) from remote locations. *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 11 hours to complete.
